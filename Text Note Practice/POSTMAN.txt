PostMan
Postman is an API Client.

API:
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions 
that allows applications to access data and interact with external 
software components, operating systems, or microservices. 
To simplify, an API delivers a user request to a system and sends 
the system's response back to a user.03-May-2021

Create Token:
jwcrypto
JWT :Json Web Token.It is used for web application.
used for microservices. RFC 7519 structurd like ecmassscript 
or Es standard specification. 
Auth Strategy : jwt token and session token.
both used for controlling Http: stateless behaviour 
meaning http does not remember all data.
We used to share data from one server to another server through 
http server.Http server does not remember all data for client useses.
For Dynamic web page users will have to send token for access 
http web page.But for Dynamic web pages it is not important.
Session id always saved iin cookie of the browser.used for Old version.
In case of mordern version: There are multiple server.
Load balancer desided that where the user token send the server1 or server2 or server3?
1 send back the session id to the user. same way again send the 
token to the browser 2 in this case browser did not recognise so that 
token always genared in Shared Radis Session DB or radis cash. 
The flow of Micrpservises is if radies server is down then session id can 
not get inspite of being all server running. That's why JWT is needed.
After creating JWT token always saved it in browser cokkie or local storage.
JWT Three Part: 
Header: Individual Json. 
Payload:Individual Json.Main Data 
Signature:Sign of an Authorization mean Secrate Key hash key.
Based 64 Encoded data is called Payload data.
Secret key is store only on server.JWT is not a password it is kind of 
user identity by which browser can easily identify the valid user.
